##NOTES
The ArmorPlus API can be excerpted for use in other projects, however it should not be modified. It can be redistributed with other mods (if it is getting used), however it should still be visible that it is a part of ArmorPlus. Do not remove the copyright header from any of the API's files and/or in the source code.
The above license  only applies for code I wrote myself, any APIs used have their own License that is being respected.
All of the assets used in this mod are made by and owned by me. You are not allowed to copy them for any other project.
Parts of this license, especially restrictive ones, can be ignored with personal permission. Said permission, however, will only be given to people I know or someone who has a very good reason for needing it.
